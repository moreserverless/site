        <h2>About</h2>

        <p>Welcome to <strong>moreserverless</strong>.</p>

        <p>I'm a software developer with a varied career background, currently working for a major healthcare organization. This site is a personal space for me to document whatever I happen to find interesting at the moment  —  projects that help me in my day-to-day work and technical curiosities worth exploring.</p>

        <p>The name <strong>moreserverless</strong> reflects my current technical focus: exploring serverless architectures, automation, and modern development workflows. It's about testing lightweight solutions in a personal sandbox to see how they might translate into more effective approaches within my professional role.</p>

        <h3>The Mission</h3>

        <p>I'm documenting my technical journey as I explore whatever catches my attention. This process lets me explore new tools and methods  —  like pushing the boundaries of AI agents or cloud integrations  —  that eventually help me approach engineering challenges with a broader perspective.</p>

        <p>The ideas often come from my work environment, but they're driven more by curiosity than necessity. Something sparks my interest, I wonder "what if," and that becomes a project worth exploring.</p>

        <h3>What You'll Find Here</h3>

        <p>This is a public version of my personal lab notes. My interests shift, but <strong>right now</strong> I'm spending my time on:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>The ADO to GCP Bridge:</strong> Connecting Azure DevOps with Google Cloud Platform hosting and automating deployments between organizational tools and cloud platforms.</li>
            <li><strong>Enterprise AI:</strong> Experimenting with LLMs and AI agents within the strict guardrails of a regulated environment—navigating the practical challenges of bringing AI tools into healthcare technology.</li>
            <li><strong>Developer Workflows:</strong> Automation projects that help me spend less time on manual configuration and tedious processes, and more time on the logic I'm currently curious about.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>AI Transparency Policy</h3>

        <p>I treat AI as a collaborator. Since this blog is about using modern tools, I'm open about how I use them:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Code Assistance:</strong> I use AI as a pair programmer for syntax, boilerplate, debugging, and troubleshooting. I handle the architecture and final implementation, but the "power tool" definitely helps me work faster.</li>

            <li><strong>Writing Partner:</strong> I use AI to help structure these posts, refine my notes, and draft technical explanations. It helps me get my thoughts onto the page so I can get back to the projects themselves.</li>

            <li><strong>Human at the Helm:</strong> Every project and post on this site has been vetted and tested by me personally. If it's here, I've put my eyes on it, made sure it works, and stand behind it.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Privacy & Professionalism</h3>

        <p>Working in healthcare means I'm always conscious of security and boundaries.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Personal Lab:</strong> Everything here is built on my own time in my personal development environments.</li>
            <li><strong>No Work Secrets:</strong> I don't share proprietary code, aternal company systems, or organizational strategies. These projects are generalized versions of technical challenges—nothing that would compromise privacy or security.</li>
            <li><strong>My Perspectives:</strong> While I work for a healthcare organization, this blog represents my personal projects and views, not my employer's.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Manual Entry:</strong>
            The above was written in collaboration with a paid Gemini account and the free tier of Claude AI (not Claude Code).
        </p>
        <p>
            It is my intention to write the bulk of everything myself and then use AI as an editor.  That didn't happen
            in this case, it was the other way around.  I fed them prompts, gave the results of one to the other
            and iterated until I was happy with it.
