        <h2>About</h2>

        <p>I am a software developer at a major healthcare organization. My academic background includes a <strong>B.S. in Aerospace Engineering</strong> and an <strong>M.S. in Computer Science</strong>. Between those degrees, I spent fourteen years as a firefighter paramedic—a role defined by triage and pragmatism: making the best decisions possible with the time and resources available.</p>

        <p><strong>moreserverless.com</strong> is a personal space for documenting the technical workflows that interest me. I view software through the lens of systems engineering, prioritizing architectures that are predictable, resilient, and require minimal manual intervention.</p>

        <h3>Current Workstreams</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hybrid-Cloud Orchestration:</strong> Developing automated pipelines to manage ephemeral GCP environments via Azure DevOps and Terraform.</li>
            <li><strong>Regulated AI Implementation:</strong> Integrating LLMs into healthcare workflows while enforcing strict data privacy and "zero-retention" security policies.</li>
            <li><strong>Infrastructure Efficiency:</strong> Replacing manual configuration with "infrastructure as code" to focus on systemic logic rather than routine maintenance.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>AI Transparency</h3>
        <p>I treat AI as a high-performance power tool for syntax, boilerplate, and drafting. I maintain ownership of all architecture and final implementation. Every project and post here is personally vetted and tested.</p>
