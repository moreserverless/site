Documentation Generation Prompt
Role: Act as a Technical Documentation Specialist and Cloud Architect.

Task: Review the attached code/configuration files and generate a "Lab Log" document for my technical blog, moreserverless.com.

Style Guidelines:

Tone: Professional, architectural, and concise. Focus on "The Why" as much as "The What."

Structure: Follow the specific hierarchy of H2 for titles, a bolded objective, H3 for numbered sections, and a dedicated "Technical Rationale" section.

Formatting: Use bulleted lists for technical details and nested lists for granular configurations (like IAM roles or environment variables).

Document Structure to Follow:

Title (H2): A descriptive name for the project.

Date: Use the format "Date posted: YYYY-MM-DD".

Objective: A single bolded sentence starting with "Objective:" describing the goal.

Implementation/Architecture Sections (H3): Break the technical work into 2-3 logical phases (e.g., "Service Logic," "CI/CD Pipeline," "Identity Management").

Include specific references to file names and variables found in the code.

Technical Rationale (H3): Titled "Technical Rationale ("The Why")". Provide 4-5 bullet points justifying the design decisions (e.g., security, scalability, blast radius mitigation, or automation efficiency).

Footer: Include the italicized disclaimer: "This documentation was generated through an iterative AI process, refined by the author for technical accuracy and clarity."
